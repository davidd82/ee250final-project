WEB FRONT END:

A simple website front end with one button. Clicking the button will execute the publish_message() function in app.js.

TO RUN:

To run the website front end, install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.

Next, right click on the source code of button.html and select "Open With Live Server". Alternatively, while in button.html, pressing command L and then command O should also start the front end.
